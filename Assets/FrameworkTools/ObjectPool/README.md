ObjectPool
==========

Instead of creating and destroying new objects all the time, this script reduces garbage by pooling instances, allowing you to seemingly create hundreds of new objects while only actually using a recycled few.


P.S.
This script is modified by ANTARES (from CatLogic) in order to work with |Transform.parent| properly.
